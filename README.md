Restaurants have inefficient waiting service processes - and modern day solutions, such as the ipad ordering system, also require significant overhead costs. Payvr brings the ipad Point-of-Sale concept to the smartphone through an app, with the use of FirstData's Clover POS system as the central point for order collection. Payvr uses QR code technology to help identify customers at a restaurant, process their orders, and simplify their payment experience. This helps restaurants improve their service capabilities and operating margins without losing customer experience quality.

Tech stack used:

Ionic
AngularJS
Google App Engine
Clover POS
